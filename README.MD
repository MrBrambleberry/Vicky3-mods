# Introduction
This repo contains source files for mods for [Victoria 3 by Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/victoria-3/about)

## Usage

On windows systems installing Victora 3 will create a `C:\Users\...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 3\` directory like this or similar. 

In this directory create a folder called `mod` - into this you can clone or download any of the sibling directories in this repo so the game can detect the mods.

To actually enable the mods, start the game and from the Paradox launcher create a "playlist" and add `better ireland` or similar. When you start the game with this playlist selected the mod will be active.
